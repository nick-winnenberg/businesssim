        <h1>Welcome to the {{scenerio.name}} used car lot.</h1>
        <p>At the car lot, you can purchase vehicles. These vehicles have different capacity and quality scores.</p>
        <h5>Capacity</h5>
        <p>Capacity is how many meals you can make before selling out! TWO things influence capacity: your employee capacity and food truck capacity. There will usually be a bottleneck dictating capacity; you need more food trucks or more employees! You, as an owner-operator, can make 750 meals by yourself in one month!</p>
        <h5>Quality</h5>
        <p>Similar to ingredient quality, your food truck and employees can increase or decrease your quality score. </p>
        <p>Can't afford the truck you want? No worries, visit the bank, meet with a VC, or give it a couple of turns!</p>
